 <h3>Fruits</h3>
<p>Fruits are nutritious, they make a tasty snack or dessert, and they can satisfy a sweet tooth.</p>

<p>Local fruits that are in season are fresher and provide more nutrients than imported fruits.</p>

<p>Fruits are high in sugar, but this sugar is natural. Unlike candies and many sweet desserts, fruits also provide fiber and other nutrients. This means they’re less likely to cause a sugar spike and they’ll boost the body’s supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</p>

<p>If you have diabetes, your doctor or dietitian can advise you on which fruits to choose, how much to eat, and when.</p>

<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p>Vegetables are a key source of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Eat a variety of vegetables with different colors for a full range of nutrients.</p>

<p>Dark, leafy greens are an excellent source of many nutrients. They include:</p>
<ul>
   <li>spinach</li>
   <li>kale</li>
    <li>green beans</li>
    <li>broccoli</li>
    <li>collard greens</li>
    <li>Swiss chard</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grains</h3>
 <p>Refined white flour is featured in many breads and baked goods, but it has limited nutritional value. This is because much of the goodness is in the hull of the grain, or outer shell, which manufacturers remove during processing.</p>

<p>Whole grain products include the entire grain, including the hull. They provide additional vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Many people also find that whole grains add flavor and texture to a dish.</p>

<h3>Proteins</h3>

 <p>Meats and beans are primary sources of protein, which is essential for wound healing and muscle maintenance and development, among other functions.</p>

<h4>Animal protein</h4>
<p>Healthy animal-based options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>red meats, such as beef and mutton</li>
<li>poultry, such as chicken and turkey</li>
<li>fish, including salmon, sardines, and other oily fish</li>
</ul>
<h4>Plant-based protein</h4>
<p>Nuts, beans, and soy products are good sources of protein, fiber, and other nutrients.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>lentils</li>
<li>beans</li>
<li>peas</li>
<li>almonds</li>
<li>sunflower seeds</li>
<li>walnuts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dairy</h3>
<p>They also contain fat. If you’re seeking to limit your fat intake, reduced fat options might be best. Your doctor can help you decide.</p>

<p>For those following a vegan diet, many dairy-free milks and other dairy alternatives are now available, made from:</p>

<ul>
<li>flax seed</li>
<li>almonds and cashews</li>
<li>soy</li>
<li>oats</li>
<li>coconut</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fats</h3>
<p>Fat is essential for energy and cell health, but too much fat can increase calories above what the body needs and may lead to weight gain.</p>

<p>In the past, guidelines have recommended avoiding saturated fats, due to concerns that they would raise cholesterol levels.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of a Balanced Diet</h2>
